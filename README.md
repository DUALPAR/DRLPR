Zefang Zong, Yikang Zhou,Hengliang Luo, Depeng Jin, Yong Li. Dual-phased Reinforcement Learning to Solve Pair-wise Routing for Express System


## Introduction

Dual-phased Reinforcement Learning for Pair-wise Routing(DALPR) is a novel structure to solve pair-wise routing problem in on-demand delivery systems.

## Dependencies

Python>=3.6

TensorFlow>=1.8

## Train DALPR

Train a model for a 50 points problem with
```bash
python mn_TW_ml_opt.py ----num_training_points 50 ----num_test_points 50 --num_paths 5 --num_paths_to_ruin 2
```

## Test

A test process is much like a training process for this iteration improve system. To load a pretrained model, add arg ```--model_to_restore ```to show its path. 

### GPU Configurations

GPU configurations are setted in '''mn_TW_ml_opt.py'''. By default, only GPU0 will be used. To use multiple GPUs, set the environment like this:
```python
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]="0, 1, 2"
```
