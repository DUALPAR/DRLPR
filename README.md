DALPR is a novel structure to solve pair-wise routing problem in on-demand delivery systems.
## Train
Train a model for a 50 points problem with
```bash
python mn_TW_ml_opt.py ----num_training_points 50 ----num_test_points 50 --num_paths 5 --num_paths_to_ruin 2
```
## Test
A test process is much like a training process for this iteration improve system. To load a pretrained model, add arg ```bash --model_to_restore ```to show its path.
