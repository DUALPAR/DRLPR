Dual-phased Reinforcement Learning for Pair-wise Routing(DALPR) is a novel structure to solve pair-wise routing problem in on-demand delivery systems.
## Dependencies

Python>=3.6

TensorFlow>=1.8

## Train DALPR
Train a model for a 50 points problem with
```bash
python mn_TW_ml_opt.py ----num_training_points 50 ----num_test_points 50 --num_paths 5 --num_paths_to_ruin 2
```

## Test
A test process is much like a training process for this iteration improve system. To load a pretrained model, add arg ```--model_to_restore ```to show its path. 




DRLPR is developed based on l2i(Hao Lu; Xingwen Zhang; Shuang Yang. 2020. A LEARNING-BASED ITERATIVE METHOD FOR SOLVING VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEMS. In Proceedings of International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).)
